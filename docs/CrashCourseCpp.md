# Crash Course C++

Based on the work Accelerated C++, distilled and reworked to squeeze it into 4 hours of work.

----

## Getting Started

Let's start where all good crash courses start, Hello world:

```cpp
/* Hello World
*  A program that does very little.
*/

#include <iostream>

int main(void) {
    std::cout << "Hello world!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

----

> Task: Compile and run the above program, ensuring that it does what you expect.
