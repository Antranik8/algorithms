## Asymptotic Analysis: Dominant Terms

---

## Some Calculous

We can think of asymptotic analysis as a limit problem:

$$O(kn^2) \rightarrow \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} O(kn^2) = O(n^2)$$

As $n \rightarrow \infty$, we know that $k$ becomes irrelevant.

Hence, when we describe "Big-Oh" notation for a given algorithm, we will always denote just the dominant term.

---

## What is the Big-Oh notation?

$$O(2n)$$

$$O(n! + n^2)$$

$$O(\frac{2^n}{2} + 80n)$$

$$O(1,000n + n^3)$$

$$O(n * \log{n} + \sqrt{n})

$$O(n + n + n + n)$$

## Working with Arrays in C++

---

## You Shall Not Pass ... by value

- Arrays in C++ cannot be passed by value
- They can only be passed as pointers (or references)

--

There are a few different ways to pass arrays:

```c++
double sum(int *array, int n) {
    // Things
}

double sum(int array[], int n) {
    // Things
}

// Very uncommon, fixed size array passing.
double sum(int array[10]) {
    // Things
}
```

--

**In this class we will deal with the first two syntaxes**

---

## You Shall (Also) Not Return Arrays

- C++ does not allow you to return arrays by value
- Again, you must use a pointer

So, how can we return arrays?

--

We cannot rely on stack allocation, since the memory will be freed when the function returns.

--

Thus our function must either directly modify the array it is passed, or allocate a new array on the heap to return.

--

**Or**, we can define new classes that handle dynamic allocation for us!

---

## Your turn to implement and analyze some functions!

1. Make sure you have updated your repository.
2. Navigate to the `source` directory.
3. You should see a `functions.hpp` header file full of new functions that handle arrays.
4. It is your job to create `functions.cpp`, implement and analyze the functions, and pass all of the unit tests.

Be sure to write clean, concise code, remember there are 25 points up for grabs!
